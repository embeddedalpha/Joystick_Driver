This file provides two functions and one global variable to be called from user application:
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fBSystemInit()\fP: This function is called at startup just after reset and before branch to main program\&. This call is made inside the 'startup_stm32f4xx\&.s' file\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
SystemCoreClock variable: Contains the core clock (HCLK), it can be used by the user application to setup the SysTick timer or configure other parameters\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fBSystemCoreClockUpdate()\fP: Updates the variable SystemCoreClock and must be called whenever the core clock is changed during program execution\&.
